  - For a second there,
  - It seemed like you forgot what to do.
  - But in the end, you managed to slay the demon king.
  - It was a long journey to get here.
  - Your friends... they're no longer who they once were.
  - The horrors of adventure were too much for them.
  - What happened to you, you wonder.
  - Why do you feel unchanged?
  - As if you're still that wide-eyed adventurere,
  - who came to this land many years ago.

  - You were walking back home from school.
  - "You aced your test and were quite giddy, imagining your mom\u2019s reaction
    to the endeavor of your efforts."
  - Crossing the street, a block before your house,
  - "Maybe it was your test\u2019s fault,"
  - causing you to be distracted by your thoughts,
  - "Or perhaps the truck driver should\u2019ve been paying more attention,"
  - Instead of being on the phone with his daughter,
  - But you felt a heavy weight ram against you
  - 'And everything went black. '

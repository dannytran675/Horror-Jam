  - Ah, so you're the hero I've been hearing about?
  - We've had many like you appear in this town in the past.
  - And so, we know how to get you home.
  - But it won't be an easy task.
  - Everyone before you has failed to reach their destination.
  - You must leave through these gates and follow the dirt path.
  - Your goal will be the Snowpeak Towers, where the Demon King resides.
  - Once you kill the Demon King, only then will you be able to return home.
  - I wish you the best of luck, O'Rusted Knight.
